Setup:

This project should have nothing special in order to set it up aside from ensuring nuget packages are restored

Notes:

Firstly thanks for your time,
In the two hours given I was able to implement importing and converting of the provided .json file, correct output and simple unit tests
My previous employment had me primarily using the output of Entity Framework (thats a story in itself) for back end dev so handling json files, albiet simplistic to think about, is something I have
little experience actually implementing hence it taking slightly longer than I would have liked and thus the missing XML import. (While I could just take the extra time to do this, I understand thats not the point of this test)

With that being said I imagine that bringing in the XML is a fairly similar principle, in a proper workplace solution i'd like to try and normalise the inputs into one object type to then work with rather than
having two distinct structures for the same workflow. Granted in an environment where its simply out of my control how many different structures I get fed then thats a whole different problem.

If you have any questions relating to this code feel free to get in touch!
